And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.  \n",

We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated.  I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient.  Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.  When I returned the 80% protein bag back the girl said a lot of people have been complaining and they aren't recommending this brand anymore.</td>\n",

       "25509   I was so shocked to find out that almost all gums have BHT.  I went to the health food store and got gum with Xylitol but I didn't like the taste.  B Fresh was the only one with Xylitol that didn't taste like aspartame.  I saw Newmans Own Organic Mints and was happy to see no aspartame or BHT and they are really good.  I hope the company starts making gum.  The only problem is the mints are made in Mexico.  What is the matter Americans can't make mints?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "38874   I called Kellogg's to see why Special K red berries has the natural preservative but Special K blueberry has the killer BHT.  The women who answered wasn't helpful and didn't know why. She also seemed annoyed with my question.  I won't even give my dog food with BHT why would I feed my family a cereal with BHT.  Why don't these company use the more natural and safer preservative like tocoperol etc?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "177087  The taste of the Newton's Fruit Thins was pretty good. It's a nice crunchy treat, and I really enjoyed the cranberry citrus and oat flavor. It was like a really thin and crisp designer oatmeal cookie.  I would have liked the product more if the cookies were smaller in size.  The snacks are rather large and round in shape, and being so thin they easily break and crumble. If they were 1/4 of the current size you could easily consume them in one or two bites and eliminate the crumbs.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. The outer foil bag isn't bad, but the inside plastic tray is clumsy and tough to slide back into the resealable wrap, and combined with the large crumbly nature of the cookie already mentioned above I doubt very much if anyone buying these in a store ends up with more than half of the cookies actually being whole by the time they get home.  Ordering them from Amazon easily guarantees half the product inside will be in pieces -- but like I said... the smaller size (even if they are broken pieces) makes 'em easier to eat!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "431604  WARNING:  I use to feed my dogs Orijen 75% protein but the last few months my dogs have had really bad diarrhea.  We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated.  I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient.  Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.  When I returned the 80% protein bag back the girl said a lot of people have been complaining and they aren't recommending this brand anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "538368  I'm a huge fan of tea and drink a LOT of it.  This is the first time I tried Higgins & Burke brand and have to say that I've never heard of it before.  English Breakfast Tea is probably my second favorite packaged tea to drink (Earl Grey being my first choice), but most brands I've tried are usually pretty similar.  Not so with this brand.  The aroma didn't seem as rich and flavor seemed somehow \"off\" to me, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what I didn't like until I read one of the other reviews here on Amazon and the reviewer described it as \"musky.\"  That's about as accurate a description as I can think of.<br /><br />I like my tea strong (leaving the bag to steep the entire time I'm drinking it) and do not add sweetener or cream or lemon.  After trying the first cup, I knew that I'd have to add something so on my second mug I added a bit of sweetener and it helped take the musky edge off, but it still wasn't what I consider a flavorful English Breakfast blend.<br /><br />If you're a fan of traditional English Breakfast Tea I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F952\">Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010DLWT4\">The Republic of Tea, British Breakfast Tea, 50-Count</a>, or even <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C69FB\">Tazo Awake Black Tea, 24-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> over the Higgins & Burke brand.  \n",
