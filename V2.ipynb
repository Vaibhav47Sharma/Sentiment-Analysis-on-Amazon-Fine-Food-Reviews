This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts.

I was so shocked to find out that almost all gums have BHT.  I went to the health food store and got gum with Xylitol but I didn't like the taste.  B Fresh was the only one with Xylitol that didn't taste like aspartame.  I saw Newmans Own Organic Mints and was happy to see no aspartame or BHT and they are really good.  I hope the company starts making gum.  The only problem is the mints are made in Mexico.  What is the matter Americans can't make mints?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n33958   B00412W76S                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n38874   B000AYDGZ2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I called Kellogg's to see why Special K red berries has the natural preservative but Special K blueberry has the killer BHT.  The women who answered wasn't helpful and didn't know why. She also seemed annoyed with my question.  I won't even give my dog food with BHT why would I feed my family a cereal with BHT.  Why don't these company use the more natural and safer preservative like tocoperol etc?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n40548   B00020HHRW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ...

WARNING:  I use to feed my dogs Orijen 75% protein but the last few months my dogs have had really bad diarrhea.  We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated.  I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient.  Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.  When I returned the 80% protein bag back the girl said a lot of people have been complaining and they aren't recommending this brand anymore.\n440825  B008LFAS08                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          this grinder is super easy to assemble and operate, after grinding 100 pounds of dog/cat food by hand, decided it was time to break down and go electric grinder, so far tested with a \"mini\" grind and was super fast, easy to set up, run and clean up, wash all parts by hand, it took a couple min. and dried and stored...took bone in raw chicken, carrots( cut in 1/4 s yams, all with ease.... comes with excellent instructions too, was going to go with the turbo 3000, had a few questions, so called Jim, who suggested this unit and it fills my needs 100% My husband and I could not be happier!<br />Nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n484367  B00020HHGS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ...

Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.
